# V.Mouse
A simple virtual mouse implemented using python and open-cv

## Necessities:
- Make sure you have python installed in your machine
- You can use any code editor of your choice.

## Libraries used:
- opencv-python
- numpy
- pyAutoGUI (for controlling mouse operations like right click, left click, simple navigation.)

### suggestions:
- This virtual mouse does not use any ML based libraries, it's pure open-cv, so it has it's own drawbacks.
- Make sure to have a proper lighting in your area as this is based on color detection, contour finding methodology
- The code written is made to filter out red color and use that as a console to control mouse movements, which can be changes upon user's choice.
